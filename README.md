# Seam Carving in Matlab

This is my implementation of  "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" (2012), for which the paper can be found at http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2012_fall/hw/proj3-seamcarving/imret.pdf.

My implementation is not the fastest, so the runner script by default displays images that have been put through the algorithm already. To run it yourself, uncomment lines 10, 17, 32, and 39, and comment out lines 11, 18, 33, and 40. 

## Example

### Source Image at 720x480:
<img src="ryerson.jpg" width="720" height="480"> 



### Image Resized to 640x480:

<img src="ryerson640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480">


### Image Resized to 720x320:

<img src="ryerson720x320.jpg" width="720" height="320">
